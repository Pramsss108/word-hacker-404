# Date: 2025-12-28

## 🚀 Project Status: 95% COMPLETE
The software is fully built, compiled, and ready. The only missing piece is the physical hardware.

### ✅ What is Done:
1.  **The App (Frontend/Backend):** Fully functional.
2.  **The UI (User Experience):**
    *   Fixed "Left Side" layout issue (Centered & Full Screen).
    *   Added "Adapter Status" indicator (Tells you to insert dongle).
    *   Added "Cyberpunk" animations and hover effects.
3.  **The Hacking Engine:**
    *   Scripts for Scanning, Deauth, and Attacks are installed.
    *   Advanced Modules (Evil Twin, GPU) support added.
4.  **The Installer:**
    *   `BUILD_RELEASE.ps1` creates a professional `.msi` installer.

### ⏳ What is Left (The Final 5%):
1.  **Hardware:** You need to receive the **Ralink RT5370** USB Adapter.
2.  **Activation:** Once you plug it in, run `CHECK_HARDWARE.ps1` to confirm it works.

## 📖 How to Use (For "No Coders")
1.  **Wait** for your Amazon delivery.
2.  **Plug in** the USB Stick.
3.  **Run** the App.
4.  **Look at the Header:** It should change from "INSERT WIFI DONGLE" to "ADAPTER CONNECTED".
5.  **Click "START RECON"** and enjoy.
