# Advanced WiFi Warfare Roadmap (Classified)

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for achieving 100% penetration success rates in the Cyber Sentinel Edu platform. 

**STATUS UPDATE: ALL MODULES INTEGRATED INTO AI AGENT LOGIC (v3.0)**

## 1. PMKID Client-less Attack (The "Vacuum" Upgrade)
**Status:** [ACTIVE]
**Agent Integration:** The AI Agent now automatically selects "The Vacuum" for networks with no active clients. It utilizes hcxdumptool logic to target RSN IE.
**Realism:** Implemented. If no clients are found during the scan phase, the Agent switches to this mode.

## 2. Evil Twin + Captive Portal (The "Chameleon" Upgrade)
**Status:** [ACTIVE]
**Agent Integration:** The "Chameleon" module is now context-aware. The AI analyzes the SSID (e.g., "Starbucks") and selects the matching phishing template.
**Realism:** Implemented. Used as a fallback escalation if dictionary attacks fail.

## 3. WPS Pixie Dust (The "Magic" Attack)
**Status:** [ACTIVE]
**Agent Integration:** Integrated into the failure recovery loop. If a standard handshake crack fails, the Agent attempts a Pixie Dust attack on WPS-enabled routers.
**Realism:** Implemented. Success rate modeled on real-world vulnerability statistics (~10-15%).

## 4. Cloud GPU Cracking (The "Titan" Module)
**Status:** [REMOVED]
**Reason:** Project policy strictly prohibits simulated/fake capabilities.
**Realism:** Feature removed. Local hardware limitations are now accurately reported to the user.

## 5. WPA3 Downgrade (The "Time Traveler" Upgrade)
**Status:** [ACTIVE]
**Agent Integration:** "The Time Traveler" module is fully integrated. The AI detects WPA3-SAE and automatically attempts to force a downgrade to WPA2-Transition mode.
**Realism:** Implemented.
