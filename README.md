# Word Hacker 404

An AI-powered word game application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Word Detective Mode**: Find hidden words with AI hints
- **Pattern Hunter**: Discover word patterns and connections (Coming Soon)
- **Speed Challenge**: Race against time with AI opponents (Coming Soon)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd word-hacker-404
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🛠️ Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## � Full RAW color setup

The RAW editor ships with a grayscale fallback so non-technical teammates can still test the workflow without the hefty LibRaw build. To unlock true 16‑bit color demosaic, install the official WebAssembly bundle once per machine:

1. **Download or build LibRaw WASM** – you need both `libraw.wasm` and its companion loader file (usually `libraw.js`) generated by Emscripten.
2. **Place the files in the project** – copy them into `public/wasm/` so the Vite dev server can serve them at `/wasm/libraw.wasm`.
3. **Restart the dev server** – stop and rerun `npm run dev` so the worker pool picks up the new module.

When the files are missing, the UI now shows a “Color fallback active” banner explaining these steps. Once the WASM loads successfully, previews and exports return to full-color 16‑bit output automatically.
