Word Hacker 404 — Vendored WASM Assets
=====================================

This directory contains the only trusted builds of LibRaw + wasm-vips that power
RAW decode. Every file is copied verbatim from the npm packages declared in
package.json and validated against a pinned SHA-256 hash.

Key facts
---------
- Source packages: libraw-wasm@1.1.2 and wasm-vips@0.0.16
- Hash manifest: manifest.json (auto-generated by npm run raw:bootstrap)
- Governance: never edit these files manually. Always regenerate via the npm
  scripts documented below so hashes stay verifiable.

Maintenance flow
----------------
1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Vendor the assets: npm run raw:bootstrap
   - Copies the upstream files into this folder
   - Validates SHA-256 for each artifact and rewrites manifest.json
3. CI/doctor check: npm run raw:doctor
   - Ensures every committed file matches the pinned hashes
   - Fails if manifest.json drifts from scripts/raw/wasm-artifacts.json

When updating to a newer upstream build, recompute hashes and update
scripts/raw/wasm-artifacts.json in the same commit that refreshes these files.
