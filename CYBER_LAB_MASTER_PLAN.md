# 🛡️ Project: "Cyber Sentinel Edu" (The White Hat Academy)

## 🚨 Mission Briefing
**Client:** Security Council of India (Educational Division)
**Objective:** Create an interactive, "Crazy Educational" Desktop Application that teaches students how to set up a professional Penetration Testing Lab and understand WiFi security protocols.
**Clearance Level:** Top Secret / Educational Use Only

---

## 🏗️ The Architecture (Hybrid: Rust + WSL 2)
**"The Invisible Engine."**

We are ditching the heavy, slow VirtualBox. We will use **WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**.
*   **Why?** It runs a real Linux kernel *inside* Windows. It starts in 1 second. It uses less RAM.
*   **The Magic:** The user sees a Windows App. The "Hacking" happens in the invisible Linux layer.

*   **Core Engine (Rust):** The "Commander". It sends orders to WSL.
*   **The Muscle (WSL 2):** Runs `aircrack-ng` natively.
*   **The Bridge (USBIP):** The advanced tech that passes your WiFi Adapter from Windows to Linux instantly.

---

## 🎓 Module 1: The Setup (The Invisible Forge)
*Refined for 2025 Speed & Smoothness.*

### 📋 Step 1: The One-Command Install
**Goal:** Install the Hacking Core without ISOs or BIOS hacking.
*   **Old Way:** Download 4GB ISO -> Install VirtualBox -> Partition Drive.
*   **The Advanced Way:**
    *   App runs: `wsl --install -d kali-linux`
    *   Result: Full Kali Linux installed in 5 minutes, invisible to the user.

### 📋 Step 2: The Hardware Bridge (USBIPD)
**Goal:** Give the "Invisible Linux" access to your Physical WiFi Adapter.
*   **The Problem:** WSL usually can't see USB hardware.
*   **The Solution (Advanced):** We automate the installation of `usbipd-win`.
    *   **Action:** User plugs in WiFi Adapter.
    *   **App:** Auto-detects and "teleports" the device to Kali: `usbipd attach --wsl --busid <ID>`
    *   **Result:** Kali now has full hardware control (Monitor Mode enabled).

### 📋 Step 3: The Arsenal (Auto-Provision)
**Goal:** Install tools silently.
*   **Command Center:** App runs a background script in WSL:
    *   `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y aircrack-ng bully reaver hcxdumptool`
*   **Verification:** Green lights appear on the Dashboard as tools come online.

---

## 📡 Module 2: WiFi Recon (The Scanner)
**"See the Invisible Waves."**

*   **Rust Backend:** Uses native OS APIs to list available WiFi networks (SSID, Signal Strength, Security Type).
*   **Educational Overlay:**
    *   Explains what "WPA2" means.
    *   Explains what "Monitor Mode" is (and why specific adapters are needed).
    *   **Visualizer:** A graph showing signal strength of nearby networks.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite (Cyberpunk UI Theme)
*   **Backend:** Rust (Tauri)
*   **State Management:** Zustand
*   **Styling:** CSS Modules / Tailwind (Matrix Green/Black theme)

---

## ⚔️ Module 3: The Red Team Engine (WiFi Penetration Tester)
**"Test. Break. Secure."**

This module automates the authorized testing workflow using `aircrack-ng`.

### 🤖 The "One-Click" Automator
Instead of typing commands manually, the App generates and executes the attack sequence.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Target Selection:** User selects their OWN network from the list.
2.  **Packet Sniffer (AI-Assisted):**
    *   Runs `airodump-ng wlan0`
    *   Captures packets to a `.cap` file.
3.  **Injection (Speed Boost):**
    *   Runs `aireplay-ng --arpreplay -0 6 wlan0 mon0`
    *   Forces traffic generation to capture the handshake faster.
4.  **The Cracker (Validation):**
    *   Runs `aircrack-ng wlan0.cap`
    *   Tests if the password is weak/crackable.

### 📜 The Script Generator (Bash)
The app will automatically generate the `wifi_test.sh` script for the user:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generated by Cyber Sentinel Edu
echo "Starting Authorized Security Test..."
airodump-ng wlan0 & 
PID_DUMP=$!
sleep 5
aireplay-ng --arpreplay -0 6 wlan0 mon0
sleep 1800
kill $PID_DUMP
aircrack-ng wlan0.cap
```

## 🌶️ Module 4: The "2025 Extra Sauce" (Modern Protection)
**"Why the Old Ways Fail."**

The classic method (ARP Replay) is effective but can be slow or detected. We will add a **"Modern Warfare"** toggle to the app.

### 1. The "Deauth" Strike (Faster Handshakes)
Instead of waiting 30 minutes (`sleep 1800`), we force the device to reconnect.
*   **Old Way:** Wait for traffic.
*   **2025 Way:** `aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a [ROUTER_MAC] wlan0`
*   **Result:** Captures the WPA2 Handshake in **seconds**, not minutes.

### 2. PMKID Attack (Client-less Attack)
*   **Concept:** Attack the router directly without waiting for a user to connect.
*   **Tool:** `hcxdumptool` (Modern replacement for simple airodump).
*   **Benefit:** Works even if no one is home.

### 3. GPU Acceleration (Hashcat)
*   **Concept:** `aircrack-ng` uses the CPU (slow).
*   **Upgrade:** The app will export the capture file to a format readable by **Hashcat** to use the Graphics Card (NVIDIA/AMD).
*   **Speed:** 1000x faster password testing.

---

## 🌐 Module 5: Protocol Mastery (The Universal Key)
**"From Ancient Ruins to Future Fortresses."**

We must ensure the tool understands ALL protocols, not just WPA2.

### 1. The Legacy: WEP & WPA1
*   **Status:** Obsolete but dangerous if found.
*   **Attack:** IV (Initialization Vector) Statistical Attack.
*   **Tool:** `aircrack-ng` (PTW method).
*   **Lesson:** "Why we stopped using this in 2004."

### 2. The Standard: WPA2 (CCMP)
*   **Status:** Most common.
*   **Attack:** 4-Way Handshake Capture + Dictionary Attack.
*   **Enhancement:** **WPS Pixie Dust Attack**.
    *   Many WPA2 routers have WPS enabled.
    *   **Tool:** `reaver` or `bully` (integrated into our script).
    *   **Result:** Cracks the PIN in seconds, revealing the password instantly.

### 3. The Fortress: WPA3 (SAE)
*   **Status:** The new standard (2025+).
*   **Defense:** Uses "Simultaneous Authentication of Equals" (Dragonfly).
*   **Attack Vector:** **Downgrade Attack**.
    *   Force the router to accept WPA2 connections if "Transition Mode" is on.
*   **Lesson:** "Why WPA3 is (almost) unhackable via dictionary attacks."

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Tech Stack (The Engine Room)
To make this "Unbelievable," we upgrade the stack.

### 🦀 Rust Backend (Supercharged)
*   **`pcap` Crate:** Direct packet capture analysis in Rust (faster than parsing text output).
*   **`tokio`:** Async runtime for handling multiple attacks (Deauth + Sniff) simultaneously.
*   **`wifi-scanner`:** Native OS API bindings for precise signal mapping.

### 🐍 Python Integration (Optional AI Layer)
*   **`scapy`:** For custom packet crafting (if we need to simulate specific attacks).
*   **`hashcat` Support:** We will auto-format captures for Hashcat (`.hc22000`) to allow GPU cracking.

## 🎭 Module 6: The Human Element (Social Engineering)
**"Why crack the code when they will give it to you?"**

When Brute Force fails (strong passwords), we target the user.

### 1. The "Doppelgänger" (Evil Twin Attack)
*   **Concept:** Create a clone of the target network.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Jam:** Disconnect users from the real WiFi (`aireplay-ng`).
    2.  **Lure:** Start a Fake AP with the *exact same name* and *stronger signal*.
    3.  **Phish:** When they connect, show a realistic "Router Firmware Update" or "Login" page.
    4.  **Capture:** The user types the password. We save it.
*   **Tool:** `wifiphisher` or `fluxion` (running in WSL).
*   **Defense Lesson:** "How to spot a fake login page."

---

## 🏢 Module 7: The Corporate Vault (Enterprise Security)
**"Big Game Hunting."**

Home routers use WPA-Personal. Offices use **WPA-Enterprise (802.1x)**.

### 1. The "Mana" Attack (Rogue Radius)
*   **Target:** Networks asking for Username & Password.
*   **Attack:** We become a malicious Access Point.
*   **Capture:** We steal the **MSCHAPv2 Hash** (Challenge/Response).
*   **Crack:** We use `asleap` or `hashcat` to turn that hash into a password.
*   **Tool:** `hostapd-mana`.

---

## 👻 Module 8: The Ghost Protocol (Evasion)
**"Be Invisible."**

### 1. MAC Address Cloning
*   **Problem:** "Whitelisting" (Router only allows specific devices).
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Scan for connected clients.
    2.  Copy the MAC address of a trusted device.
    3.  Disconnect the real device.
    4.  Connect as the clone.
*   **Tool:** `macchanger`.

---

## 🌌 Module 10: The "God Mode" (AI & 0-Days)
**"50,000 Years Ahead. The Unfair Advantage."**

Standard hackers attack the *protocol* (WPA2). We attack the *machine* and the *math*.

### 1. The "Router Sploit" Engine (Firmware Autopsy)
*   **Concept:** Why knock on the door (crack password) when the window is open?
*   **Attack:** Scans the specific router model for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
*   **Tool:** `routersploit` (The Metasploit for Routers).
*   **Payloads:**
    *   Default Credential Scanner (admin/admin).
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits.
    *   Directory Traversal.

### 2. The "Oracle" (AI Password Prediction)
*   **Concept:** Humans are predictable.
*   **Old Way:** Try every word in the dictionary (Billions of tries).
*   **God Mode:** Use **PCFG (Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars)** and **LLMs**.
*   **Logic:**
    *   SSID: "StarkTower" -> AI guesses "IronMan123", "Jarvis2025".
    *   SSID: "Netgear5G" -> AI guesses specific factory default patterns.
*   **Tool:** Custom Python AI model trained on `rockyou.txt` + Local LLM.

### 3. The "Hive Mind" (Distributed Cracking)
*   **Concept:** One laptop is weak. A thousand are a supercomputer.
*   **Feature:** "Grid Compute" Toggle.
*   **Action:** Send the captured handshake to our (optional) cloud cluster or other local devices to crack in parallel.

## 📡 Module 11: The Omni-Spectrum (Beyond WiFi)
**"We See Everything."**

WiFi is just one frequency. The world is drowning in signals.

### 1. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Sniper
*   **Target:** Smart Locks, IoT Bulbs, Trackers.
*   **Tool:** `bettercap` (BLE module).
*   **Action:** Spoof a phone to unlock a smart lock.

### 2. SDR (Software Defined Radio) Integration
*   **Target:** Garage Door Openers, Car Keyfobs (Sub-GHz).
*   **Hardware:** RTL-SDR or HackRF (Optional Add-on).

## ⚡ Module 13: The "Zero-Touch" Engines (Automated Warfare)
**"The Tools That Hack While You Sleep."**

We are integrating the absolute peak of automated hacking engines used by nation-state red teams.

### 1. The "Pwnagotchi" Engine (Reinforcement Learning)
*   **Concept:** An AI that *learns* the best way to hack your specific environment.
*   **Engine:** `Pwnagotchi` (ported to run in our WSL container).
*   **Behavior:** It "eats" handshakes. It gets smarter. It knows when to hide and when to attack based on signal patterns.

### 2. The "Wifite2" Engine (The Lazy King)
*   **Concept:** The ultimate "Fire and Forget" engine.
*   **Capability:** Chains EVERY attack automatically.
    *   WPS Pixie -> PMKID -> 4-Way Handshake -> WEP.
    *   If one fails, it instantly tries the next.
*   **Integration:** Our Rust backend will wrap `wifite` to provide a clean GUI for this chaotic engine.

### 3. The "Kismet" Engine (The Mapper)
*   **Concept:** Total situational awareness.
*   **Capability:** Passive sniffing. It sees *hidden* networks, drones, and devices that aren't even connected.
*   **Visual:** Generates a "Heatmap" of WiFi signals in your area.

## 🛡️ Module 14: The Blue Team (Defense)
**"Hardening the Shields."**

After the test, the app provides a **Security Report**:
*   "Your password was cracked in 2 minutes."
*   **Recommendation:** "Switch to WPA3."
*   **Recommendation:** "Disable WPS (Vulnerability Detected)."
*   **Recommendation:** "Use a 16-character complex password."
