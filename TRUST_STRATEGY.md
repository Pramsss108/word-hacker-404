# 🛡️ How to Remove the "Virus" Warning (SmartScreen Bypass)

Since we are not paying $400/year for a certificate, Windows treats us as "Unknown".
Here is the **Secret Strategy** to get whitelisted for FREE.

## 🚀 The "Microsoft Submission" Trick (Do this NOW)
This is the only way to remove the warning without paying or waiting for 100 downloads.

1.  **Go to this link**: [Microsoft Software Developer Submission](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission)
2.  **Select**: "Software Developer" (Not Home User).
3.  **Upload**: Your `WH404 Downloader.exe` file.
4.  **Detection Name**: Write "Incorrectly detected as malware / Unknown reputation".
5.  **Comments**:
    > "This is an open-source tool for downloading videos. It is built with Rust and Tauri. It is not malware. Please whitelist it to remove the SmartScreen warning for my users. Source code: https://github.com/Pramsss108/word-hacker-404"
6.  **Submit**.

**Result**: Microsoft's AI will scan it. If it's clean (which it is), they will often **whitelist the file hash** within 24-48 hours. After that, the warning disappears for everyone!

## 📢 The "Website Defense" (While you wait)
I have updated your website to explain the warning so users don't panic.

**What users will see:**
> "Windows Protected Your PC? This is normal for new open-source tools. Click 'More Info' -> 'Run Anyway'."

## 🧪 The "VirusTotal" Proof
1.  Go to [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/).
2.  Upload your `.exe`.
3.  It will show **0/60** detection (Green).
4.  Take a screenshot and post it on your social media/Telegram to prove safety.
