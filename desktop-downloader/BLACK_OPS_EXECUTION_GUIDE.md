# CYBER SENTINEL: GOD MODE PROTOCOLS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AUTHORITY LEVEL: OMNI**
> **SYSTEM STATUS: GOD MODE ACTIVE**
> The system has been upgraded to "God Mode". All artificial barriers have been removed.

## 👁️ The "All-Seeing" Eye (Deep Scan)
The new **Deep Scan Engine** automatically extracts metadata that is normally hidden:
-   **Hidden Streams:** Detects m3u8 playlists hidden behind API obfuscation.
-   **DRM Flags:** Instantly identifies Widevine/PlayReady encrypted assets.
-   **Subtitle Extraction:** Rips all available `caption_tracks` (VTT/SRT).
-   **Supplementary Assets:** Identifies attached PDFs/Zips.

## 💀 FORCE EXTRACT (The Nuclear Option)
If an asset is marked as `[DRM DETECTED]`, the download button transforms into **"FORCE EXTRACT"**.

**Clicking this initiates the following:**
1.  **Key Hunt:** Attempts to extract the AES-128 key from the manifest.
2.  **Raw Dump:** If valid keys are found, it decrypts on the fly. If not (e.g. Widevine L1), it dumps the **Encrypted Stream** to disk for offline cryptanalysis.
3.  **Subtitle Merge:** Automatically embeds all found subtitles into the final MKV/MP4 container.

### METHOD 1: LAUNCH SATELLITE (Fully Automated)
1. Click **"Launch Satellite"**.
2. A secure browser window ("Ghost Browser") will open. **(Note: This window has NO extensions).**
3. Log in to your account.
4. **Click "My Learning"** to trigger a network call.
5. A **GREEN BANNER** will appear in the center of the screen when the token is captured.
6. Only close the window when the app says "ACCESS GRANTED".

### METHOD 2: MANUAL INJECTION (DevTools)
1. Open your normal browser (Chrome/Edge).
2. Press `F12` -> Console.
3. Type `copy(UD.accessToken)` and press Enter.
4. Paste into the "Method 2" box.

### METHOD 3: COOKIE STEAL (Smart Paste)
**Use this if you have a cookie extension like "EditThisCookie".**
1. Open your **Normal Chrome/Edge Browser** (NOT the Satellite).
2. Open your Cookie Extension.
3. Click "Export" or "Copy All Cookies".
4. Go back to Word Hacker 404.
5. Click **"Paste from Clipboard"**.
6. The app will search the messy cookie string and find the key automatically.

## ⚡ Execution Workflow
1.  Open **Stealth Browser**.
2.  **Launch Satellite** & Login.
3.  Wait for the **Course Matrix** to load.
4.  Look for the **[DRM DETECTED]** badge.
5.  Click **"FORCE EXTRACT"**.

> [!TIP]
> **Impossible to Fail:** Even if the video cannot be played (missing keys), the *file itself* will be acquired. Use external tools (`mp4decrypt`) with your own CDM to finish the job if necessary.

**"We do not knock. We enter."**
