## 🔒 **ALTERNATIVE: Self-Signed (INSTANT but NOT TRUSTED)**

If you want to test NOW (while waiting for SignPath):

### MY STEPS (I'll do this):
```powershell
# Generate self-signed certificate
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type CodeSigning -Subject "CN=Word Hacker 404"

# Sign the binary
signtool sign /f certificate.pfx /p password word-hacker-tool.exe
```

### Result:
- ✅ Binary is signed
- ⚠️ Windows shows "Unknown Publisher" warning
- ⚠️ Users need to click "Run Anyway"
- ✅ Better than nothing
