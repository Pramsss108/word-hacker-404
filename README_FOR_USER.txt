## 🎮 How to Use

### Mode 1: Simulation (No Hardware)

*   You can click **SCAN** to see fake targets.
*   You can click **ATTACK** or **GOD MODE** to see how the hacking process looks.
*   **Safe for learning!**

### Mode 2: Real Hacking (Hardware Required)
*   **Requirement:** You must plug in a supported USB WiFi Adapter (e.g., TP-Link TL-WN722N, Alfa AWUS036NHA).
*   **Setup:** Ensure you have installed the drivers for your adapter.
*   **Action:**
    1. Open the App.
    2. It should say **"WSL Status: ONLINE"**.
    3. Click **START RECON** to see real networks around you.
    4. Select a target (YOUR OWN NETWORK ONLY).
    5. Click **WIFI JAMMER** to disconnect devices.

## ⚠️ Legal Warning
This tool is for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**.
*   Only test on networks **YOU OWN**.
*   Jamming or hacking other people's WiFi is **ILLEGAL**.
*   The "God Mode" is powerful. Use it responsibly.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
*   **"WSL Offline"**: Make sure you ran the `INIT_CYBER_SENTINEL.ps1` script to install Kali Linux.
*   **"No Adapter Found"**: Ensure your USB adapter is plugged in and you have run `usbipd attach` if using WSL manually (the app tries to handle this, but sometimes manual intervention is needed for the first time).

Enjoy your new Cyber Deck!
